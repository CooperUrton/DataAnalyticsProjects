# Restaurant Orders Analysis
## Background
This is one of my first few Data Analysis Projects where I practice some of the techniques I have been learning. This project is originally a guided project from [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/guided-projects/d7167b45-6317-49c9-b2bb-42e2a9e9c0bc).

The queries I wrote in this project were done on my own and then compared to the queries shown in their solutions to make sure I returned the correct results. 

## Task
Practice finding pertinent information about prices and sales.

## Questions
- What items are most and least expensive
- What are the prices in each category
- What were the largest orders
- What were the least and most ordered items
- What were the largest orders
